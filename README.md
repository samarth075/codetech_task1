## Overview of the Project
**Project Name**: Simple Calculator in Java

## Input from the User:
- The program uses the `Scanner` class to read input from the user.
- It prompts the user to enter two numbers (`num1` and `num2`).
- The user is also asked to choose an arithmetic operation: 
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)

## Switch Case to Perform Operation:
- A switch statement is used to handle the operation based on the user's choice:
  - **Addition (`+`)**: Adds the two numbers.
  - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies the two numbers.
  - **Division (`/`)**: Divides the first number by the second, with a check to prevent division by zero.

  ##Technologies Used**:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Libraries/Tools Used**: 
  - Java Scanner class for user input
  - Conditional statements (Switch-case) for selecting operations

## Error Handling:
- The program includes a check for division by zero. 
- If the second number is zero and the user selects division, the program outputs an error message stating that division by zero is not allowed.



## Output:
- The result of the selected arithmetic operation is printed to the console.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective calculator application using Java. The program takes user input and performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—while also handling edge cases such as division by zero. It showcases the use of control structures like switch-case and error handling, making it a good introduction to basic Java programming concepts.
